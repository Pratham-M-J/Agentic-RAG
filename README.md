# ðŸ“š PDF Q&A â€” Intelligent Document Query App

This lightweight app offers a simple implementation of an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It allows you to upload a document and ask questions, routing your query to either a summarization or retrieval engine based on the intent. Built to demonstrate the basics of multi-tool LLM systems using LlamaIndex and Streamlit.

## ðŸ”® Features

- ðŸ§¾ Upload any PDF and ask **natural language** questions
- ðŸ§  Dual-indexing with:
  - **Summarization Index** for overviews
  - **Vector Index** for semantic fact retrieval
- ðŸ§­ Uses **RouterQueryEngine** to automatically pick the best tool
- ðŸ“¦ Fully modular â€” plug in **any LLM** or **embedding model** you love
- ðŸŽˆ Built with **Streamlit**, **LlamaIndex**, and **HuggingFace Embeddings**

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Upload a PDF through the frontend.
2. The file is parsed and chunked using `SentenceSplitter`.
3. Two indexes are created:
   - `SummaryIndex`: captures document-wide context for summarization
   - `VectorStoreIndex`: supports retrieval and semantic search
4. A `RouterQueryEngine` decides whether the query is best handled via:
   - ðŸ“„ Summary Tool â†’ "Give me a TL;DR"
   - ðŸ”Ž Vector Tool â†’ "Whatâ€™s the authorâ€™s stance on X?"
5. Boom. Instant insights.
